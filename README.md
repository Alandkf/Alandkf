# Alandkf — Backend Work & Live Projects

Hi — I’m Aland (Alandkf). I build backends that power real web platforms: REST APIs, auth systems, transactional flows, and database schemas optimized for production.  
If you’re an HR/recruiter: I focus on backend engineering using Node.js/Express and MySQL, and I ship code that users rely on.

---

## 🔧 What I do (backend-focused)
- Design and implement RESTful APIs with clear, versioned endpoints
- Build authentication and role-based access control (RBAC)
- Model relational databases and optimize SQL queries for performance
- Implement transactional business flows and ensure data integrity
- Integrate file uploads, background jobs, and real-time features (Socket.io)
- Deploy and maintain services (Heroku, Git-based workflows)

## 🚀 Highlighted backend projects

### Tutelage — Language learning platform (Live: https://www.tutelage.krd/)
**Role:** Backend lead (Node.js / Express / MySQL)  
**What I built:** Backend APIs for user management, courses, enrollment flows, progress-tracking, admin panels, and secure content delivery. Implemented RBAC for learners vs admins, transactional enrollment flows, file upload handling, and optimized DB schemas for course/progress queries. Coordinated with Next.js frontend for SSR and client flows.

### KnowYourRights — Legal assistance platform
**Role:** Backend developer (Node.js / Socket.io / MySQL)  
**What I built:** REST APIs, real-time chat (Socket.io), file upload handlers, notification system, and moderation endpoints. Deployed backend to Heroku and maintained data integrity with Sequelize + MySQL.

### FindYourDoctor — Healthcare discovery app
**Role:** Backend developer (Node.js / Sequelize / MySQL)  
**What I built:** Secure role-based access control, discovery/search endpoints, and admin dashboards. Managed deployment and DB migrations.

## 📂 Try my backend locally
(Short run steps for a recruiter/tech lead who wants to evaluate)
1. Clone the repo
2. `npm install`
3. Create a `.env` with DB connection and JWT secrets
4. `npm run migrate` (if applicable)
5. `npm start`
6. Use Postman to hit `/api/health`, `/api/auth/login`, `/api/users` (example endpoints)

## 📈 Quick wins & metrics (add yours)
- Deployed backend for Tutelage (live) — handles course content and enrollment flows
- Implemented Socket.io chat and notifications in KnowYourRights
- Reduced average query time on critical endpoints by optimizing indices (add concrete numbers here)

If you want, I can:
- Trim this README to a one-page recruiter-friendly summary.
- Generate a README variant that includes code snippets (example auth flow) and badges.
- Add explicit `curl` samples for key endpoints.
